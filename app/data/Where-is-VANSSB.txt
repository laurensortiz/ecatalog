SELECTDB, our standard demo tenant, is the only tenant content directory committed to the
eCatalog repository moving forward.

All other tenant content directories have been moved into their respective Services
repositories.

If you would like to test eCatalog in your local server environment with a tenant other 
than SELECTDB, you will need to Check Out the services repository for the tenant you wish 
to test with then SymLink the tenant content directory into your app/data directory.

For example, if you would like to test eCatalog in your local NodeJS server using the 
VANSSB tenant, you would do the following:

	1 - Check out the Vans services repository from the following URL
		https://svn.conductiv.com/repos/svc-vans.
		
	2 - Go to a command prompt and change to your eCatalog app/data directory. 
		(e.g.; cd ~/dev/conductiv/ecatalog/trunk/app/data)
	
	3 - Create a SymLink with the appropriate tenant name pointing to the appropriate 		services directory for that tenant.
		(e.g.; ln -s "~/dev/conductiv/services/vans/trunk/ecat-files" VANSSB
	
	4 - Open your SVN Client and set it to "Ignore" the SymLink you added
		so that it doesn't accidentally get added to the repository. 
		
Now you should be able to run eCatalog locally with the new tenant.
